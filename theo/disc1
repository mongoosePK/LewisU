	Introduction to Theology appeals to me because I enjoy philosophy
and would like to expand my ability to understand the spiritual dimension 
of life. Of course, as a Computer Science major, this course is an elective.
That does not mean that I place less importance in the material.
In fact,  I think that philosophical and spiritual questions have important 
implications in my chosen field of study. The technologies I work with impact
every facet of human life, and, as a result, "the Trolley Problem" has 
become more pressing an issue than "the Travelling Salesman Problem." And, 
so, I ponder.

	I spent my pre-teen years in a non-religious environment. In the 
sixth grade I attended a catholic school called St Francis of Asisi. 
After that my parents were born again in the Methodist Faith. I participated.
I now consider myself spiritual but not religious, and I try to accept 
wisdom in faith without necessarily subscribing to its dogma.

	I have largely considered institutional religion absurd for the most
of my life. I now better understand its value. I think the relationship beween 
the divine and the individual should be less mediated by the clergy, 
especially as the ability to share information becomes less restricted. For 
reasons similar to the ones above, I think that considering religion 
(or at least life's spiritual and moral dimensions) is becoming more relevant
if only to better understand other people.

	Overall, I hope to gain insight in to humanity and morality from 
this class. It is also important to me that I develop a better vocabulary 
with regards to religion and religious theories. I hope that the readings 
shed some light on to the Human Condition without being too dry.
