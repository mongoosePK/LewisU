The impact of a natural disaster is often measured by a handful of numbers: 
the number of fatalities and injuries, the number of homes and buildings 
destroyed, the cost of cleanup and repair. It doesn’t often account for 
the emotional wounds inflicted on survivors.

Even after the torrential rains end, or the flood recedes, or the fire 
burns out, many people continue to feel an enormous amount of stress and 
anxiety. And, scientists predict catastrophic weather events will become 
more frequent (and more extreme) with rising global temperatures, putting 
more people at risk for mental health problems.

Social media platforms such as Twitter are widely used to express affective states, often
in relation to particular entities, topics or events. We use the term “affect” to encompass
sentiment, emotion, mood, and other related mental states.

The automatic detection of affect from tweets1 has become a popular task due to its
importance in commerce, politics, and sports (Liu, 2012). Most successful solutions to this
problem, including its many variations, are based on supervised machine learning models
trained on manually annotated examples (Mohammad et al., 2018).
